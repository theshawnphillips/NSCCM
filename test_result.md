However, document creation fails with a 400 error (Request failed with status code 400). The API returns 'Empty names are not allowed.' The issue is in the file upload request where the path parameter is being sent correctly (Design\\TestDoc_1751912381.epr) but the API is still rejecting it."

However, document creation still fails with a 400 error and 'Empty names are not allowed' message. The API is still rejecting the path parameter despite the format change. Additionally, there appears to be an issue with folder loading in the UI - the folders are being returned by the API but not displayed in the UI."

The issue appears to be on the API side, which is still rejecting the request with the same error message. The folder tree is now displaying correctly, showing the 'Design' folder."

        comment: "Document creation is now working successfully when using the 'Batch Project' folder inside the 'Design' folder. The API returns a successful response with status code 200 and the correct path 'Design\\Batch Project\\BatchTest_1751914354.epr'. The issue with the 'Empty names are not allowed' error has been resolved by using the 'Batch Project' subfolder as specified in the review request. However, there's a minor issue where the newly created document doesn't immediately appear in the file list, even though the API confirms successful creation."

    message: "Authentication is now working with the provided credentials. The login, folder navigation, and folder selection functionality work correctly. However, document creation fails with a 400 error. The API returns 'Empty names are not allowed.' The issue appears to be in how the file upload request is being handled."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "After further testing, I've identified that the document creation issue is related to the file upload API call. The path parameter is being correctly sent as 'Design\\TestDoc_1751912381.epr', but the API is still returning 'Empty names are not allowed.' This suggests there might be an issue with how the API is parsing the path or with the format of the path parameter. The issue could be in either the uploadNewDocumentViaProxy function in eos.js or in the proxy server's file upload endpoint."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "I've tested the document creation functionality after the path format fix (changing backslashes to forward slashes), but it's still failing with the same 'Empty names are not allowed' error. The API is still rejecting the path parameter. Additionally, there's an issue with folder loading in the UI - the API is returning folders but they're not being displayed in the UI. This might be related to how the folder tree is being built or rendered. The issue might be deeper than just the path format and could involve how the API is handling the path parameter or how the file upload request is being constructed."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "After additional testing with detailed request/response logging, I've confirmed that the document creation is still failing with the same error. The proxy logs show that the request is being sent correctly with the path parameter as 'Design/DebugTest_1751913375.epr', and the file is being included in the request with the correct name and size (6144 bytes). The issue appears to be on the API side, which is still rejecting the request with the same error message. The folder tree is now displaying correctly, showing the 'Design' folder. The problem might be related to how the API expects the path parameter to be formatted or how it's processing the file upload request. It's possible that the API requires a different format for the path parameter or additional parameters that are not being sent."
